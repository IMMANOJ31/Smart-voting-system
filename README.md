The smart voting system is designed with a dual focus on security and user-friendliness. Voters' 
facial data is securely captured and stored during a registration phase, safeguarded by advanced 
encryption techniques. On election day, voters can cast their ballots swiftly and securely by 
simply having their faces scanned at the voting kiosk. This not only expedites the voting 
process but also enhances accessibility, particularly for individuals with disabilities or those 
who may find traditional voting methods cumbersome. 

Commands to run the code:
To add face : python.addfaces
To give vote :python.givevotes
